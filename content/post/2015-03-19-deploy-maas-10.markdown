Continue to deploy OpenContrail based on OpenStack.      
First we install the bzr for fetching back the charms:

$ sudo apt-get install bzr

```
Clone the repository to local Mass Controller Machine:    

```
$ bzr branch lp:~robert-ayres/+junk/contrail-deployer

```
Install juju-deployer for deploying:

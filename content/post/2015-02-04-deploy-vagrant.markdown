### Installation
Couldn't install the vagrant via rubygems, so we directly download packages in vagrantup.com, rpm for OpenSuse.    
[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)    
[https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.7.2_x86_64.rpm](https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.7.2_x86_64.rpm)    
Install it via `rpm -ivh xxxx.rpm`.

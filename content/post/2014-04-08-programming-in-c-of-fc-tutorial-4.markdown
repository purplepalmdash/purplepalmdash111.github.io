###Full Circle C 6
####Using valgrid for memory check
See [www.valgrind.org](www.valgrind.org) for more information for using the valgrind available tools.     
memcheck is the main topic in this chapter.     
this tool override libc calls that deal with handling memory. And it will do some bookkeeping. is all memory given back to the system, and is all the allocated memory still reachable?     

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void leak()
{
        char *ptr = malloc(10);
        printf("malloc(10) points to: %p\n", ptr);
}

int main()
{
        int i = 0;
        for(i = 0; i<10; i++)
        {
                leak();
        }
        char *ptr = malloc(15);
        printf("malloc(15) in main: %p\n", ptr);
        while(1){}
        return 0;
}

```
The result shows:     

```

```
If we change the code into following, this means valgrid won't interpret the output, so this will let the tracked memory add 10    

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void leak()
{
        char *ptr = malloc(10);
        printf("malloc(10) points to: %p\n", ptr);
}

int main()
{
        int i = 0;
        for(i = 0; i<10; i++)
        {
                leak();
        }
        char *ptr = malloc(15);
        printf("malloc(15) in main: %p\n", ptr);
        //while(1){}
        return 0;
}

```

Compile and verify:    

```

```
From the above output, we can see, it access /proc/stat and /proc/vmstat for output message.    
####exercise 2
Repeat the ltrace /strace example on wget with ivalid URL, TBD    
####exercise 3
Does valgrind automatically trace child process?      

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* For using fork() */
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* Using errono */
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>


void leak()
{
        char *ptr = malloc(10);
        printf("malloc(10) points to: %p\n", ptr);
}

int main(void)
{
        pid_t child;
        /* Parent do leak() */
        int i = 0;
        for(i = 0; i<10; i++)
        {
                leak();
        }

        /* Now fork a child process */
        if((child = fork()) < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "fork of child failed: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                return 1;
        }
        else if(child == 0) {
                printf("Now its in child process\n");
                sleep(2);
        }
        else {
                // parent will exit immediately !
                printf("Parent will exit!\n");
                sleep(1);
                return 0;
        }

        // Only Child comes here
        printf("Only child comes here!\n");
        for(i = 0; i<10; i++)
        {
                leak();
        }

        return 0;
}

```
We use following command for tracing the output:     

```

```
From the above output, we can see valgrid also tracked the child process's memory usage.

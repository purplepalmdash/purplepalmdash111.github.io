#### grunt-contrib-watch

Following command will install grunt-contrib-watch and update the package.json:    

```
$ npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev

```
watch :{
    scripts :{
      files : ['js/app.js','*.md','css/*.css'],
      tasks : ['uglify','markdown']
    }
  }

```
Add following line to Gruntfile for watch task:    

```
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');

```
Now run `grunt watch`, then modify some files, like `app.js` under `js` folder, then detect if the generated files are modified or not.    

Now run `grunt watch`, then modify some files, like `app.js` under `js` folder, then detect if the generated files are modified or not.     
#### livereload
Edit the watch's configuration, enable the livereload, this will enable the service in 35729 port. Or you could modify the service port by yourself.    
Add content into the templates/index.html:    

```
<script src="http://localhost:9090/livereload.js"></script>

```
Now every single modification will let you see the final result immediately.   

### Day 8 Harp.JS
Install the Harp.JS via:     

```
$ sudo npm install -g harp

```
Then initiate the blog via:    

```
$ harp init blog

I have to finish the following things: <br />

* Python Scripts which fetch back the Baidu disk, finish the exception. 
* RealTime OS on ATMEga328. 
* Python API for fetching back the pm data should be updated.
* tumx learning. 
* Use markdown for writing the CV. 
* Hard disk cleaning and orgnization. 
* Writing articles for enum feature. 
* Maybe the pelican template should be written.

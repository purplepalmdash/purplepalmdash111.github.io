### Background
Since SteelSeries Engine 3 USB mouse have only driver for Windows/MAC, I want to enable
the changing color under Linux, following is the hacking steps.     

### Catching Packets
Using Wireshark for capturing the USB Packages of mouse, at the meantime, use another
mouse for clicking the setting color area, to capture the setting color events, After
this we sent the captured packets to Linux machine for analysing.

### Setting Color
With the filter and continue for anlysing, found each setting step includes 3 steps.   

Result:

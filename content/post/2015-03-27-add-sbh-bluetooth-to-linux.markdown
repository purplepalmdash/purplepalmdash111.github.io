I bought a SBH Sony Bluetooth headset, following is the steps for adding it to system.      
### Ubuntu Installation
Install bluetooth related software:    

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y blueman-manager bluetooth
$ vim ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua
autorunApps =
{
--.........
"blueman-manager",
"fcitx",
```

### Add Device
Use Blueman for adding the equiment, first click the SBH headset to let it enter discover mode, also in blueman we enable the discover mode too, when setup the equipment, the code you have to enter is 0000.    
The device kindle is not headset, but the a2dp?     
### Add Configuration for ALSA
Edit the /etc/asound.conf, my configuration file is listed as following:     

```
pcm.btheadset {
   type plug
   slave {
       pcm {
           type bluetooth
           device xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
           profile "auto"
       }   
   }   
   hint {
       show on
       description "BT Headset"
   }   
}
ctl.btheadset {
  type bluetooth
}  
pcm.sbhbtheadset {
   type plug
   slave {
       pcm {
           type bluetooth
           device xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
           profile "auto"
       }   
   }   
   hint {
       show on
       description "SBH BT Headset"
   }   
}
ctl.sbhbtheadset {
  type bluetooth
}  

```
The first equipment is another bluetooth headset. We define our SDH to sdhbtheadset.    
Examine our added equipment via following command:    

```
$ aplay -L

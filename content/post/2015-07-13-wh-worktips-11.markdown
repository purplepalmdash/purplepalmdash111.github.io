### CentOS7 Based
Following modification need to be done:    
On Deployed node:    

```
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
10.47.58.157	node157
```

There will be iptables issue. for you have to install following packages:    

```
# yum install -y install iptables-utils iptables-services
# reboot
```

Now begin to install again, and it will be ok.    

Add the client, and make sure the "COPY CPU configuration" is selected in the menu.    
Or, your system vm won't startup.    

Why at home my output becomes:    

```
[root@node157 network-scripts]# cat ifcfg-cloudbr0 

DEVICE=cloudbr0

ONBOOT=yes
HWADDR=52:54:00:73:86:D2

TYPE=Bridge
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
NM_CONTROLLED=no
[root@node157 network-scripts]# cat ifcfg-eth0 
DEVICE=eth0

ONBOOT=yes
HWADDR=52:54:00:73:86:D2
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BRIDGE=cloudbr0

```

Check your DXG Version, make sure you have the something like 2.5.X(Under Menu->Settings->Device Infor), Mine is: Kindle 2.5.8.   
    
In setting->Menu->Reset to Factory Default. Notice after this step, your personal information will be erased, so make sure you have backed up all of your data.   
Download the jailBreak package from [dl.dbank.com/c00mask6e2](http://dl.dbank.com/c00mask6e2, "jailbreak download link"), unzip it and you will get the file named "update_jailbreak_0.7.N_k3gb_install.bin", copy it into the root directory of your kindle, then eject your kindle and run "settings->update your kindle" , after a little while, your kindle will reboot and now your jailbreak has been done.   
    
Then Download the font files from "the update_fonts_4.6.N_dxg_install.zip": [http://pan.baidu.com/s/17UmSg](http://pan.baidu.com/s/17UmSg, "font update package"), and the linkfont file from the "linkfonts - by麦兜电纸书.rar" : [http://pan.baidu.com/s/1oXvF2](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1oXvF2, "Link font file download").     
   

First unpack the font update package and get the .bin file, copy it into your root directory of the DXG, run "Settings"->"update your kindle", update succeed and then reboot, after reboot, copy the linkfonts files into the directory linkfonts, reboot and now you can enjoy the chinese reading.

###Download the toolchain
We should download the toolchain from the ARM employee maintained website, the download address is located at: [https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded), use following command:

```
	$ wget https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.7/4.7-2013-q3-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q3-20130916-linux.tar.bz2

```
untar the downloaded package and then add it to your system path, my solution is directly add some alias into ~/.bashrc:

```
	### Add Cross_Compiler for eclipse based stm32
	#export PATH="/media/y/embedded/cortex/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q3/bin:$PATH"
	alias setstm='export PATH="/media/y/embedded/cortex/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q3/bin:$PATH"'

```
###Eclipse Configuration
We have to install zylin for flashing the stm32 board. After installation, eclipse will be rebooted.

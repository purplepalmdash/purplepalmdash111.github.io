Following things got to be done in recent days:   

+   Try different distribution and found the difference and package differences between them(edubuntu, opensuse, fedora, etc).
+   Django/mezzanine, and other python based web development framework.
+   Write your own django based or mezzenine based blog/CMS. 
+   __Repair my own computer, and run some cloud on it. __ 
+   __Pogoplug own kernel image compilation. __
+   RaspberryPI own distribution developement. 
+   __Download all of the Full Circle using my own script, use it for practicing programming skills. __

###What is Xively?    
Xively Cloud Services™     
The world’s first IoT Public Cloud  
###How to get start?
Read tutorial and generate an API.   
Then you can visit your own APP under: WEB TOOLS-> DEVELOP -> something.  
Create a new Development Devices, named "Raspberry Pi", xively will automatically generate the API Keys and the feed id for this developement device.   

The key issue for using APIs is "talk" to the APIs and upload the data to the website.

After 4 days struggling, I finally make bluetooth headset working on my ArchLinux. Following is the detailed how-to which shows how to enable bluetooth playing.   
###Software Installation
Currently blueman is still the best bluetooth management software, we can install it via:

```
	$ yaourt blueman
	1 aur/blueman-bzr 726-2 [installed] (38)
	    GTK+ bluetooth management utility

```
Then we have to install bluez related items:

```
	$ pacman -S bluez-utils bluez-libs python2-pybluez
	$ yaourt -S bluez4
	$ yaourt pulseaudio-bluez4

```
###Bluetooth Configuration
First make sure your bluetooth service is enabled.    

```
	$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth
	$ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

```
Now we need to make change to following files:

```
	[Trusty@XXXyyy ~]$ cat /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf
	
	[General]
	Enable=Socket
	
	[A2DP]
	SBCSources=1

```
Now we can manually startup blueman manager via: 

```
	$ blueman-manager

```
![blueman.jpg](/images/blueman.jpg)    
Click "Search" to find the avaiable headset, pair, trust, setup. Right click the found headset, choose "Audio Sink", if successful, you will see the equipment has been successfully added into the system.    
Add blueman automatically to the system startup script. We can add it into the awsome window manager:  

```
	autorunApps = 
	{ 
	--.........
	"blueman-manager",
	--.........
	}

```
###PulseAudio Configuration
First we have to define the alsa device in /etc/asound.conf: 

```
	pcm.btheadset {
	   type plug
	   slave {
	       pcm {
	           type bluetooth
	           device 8C:64:goewugowugoeu
	           profile "auto"
	       }   
	   }   
	   hint {
	       show on
	       description "BT Headset"
	   }   
	}
	ctl.btheadset {
	  type bluetooth
	}  

```
Now via "aplay -l" we can see the following item:

```
	$ aplay -L
	null
	    Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
	pulse
	    PulseAudio Sound Server
	btheadset
	    BT Headset

```
In fact currently we can play sounds via mplayer, by specifying its default audio path is OK. But we want to make this audio sink path globally.     
The steps for manually enabling the audio sink path via following steps:    
Load device of btheadset

```
	$ pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset	

```
Load bluetooth discover module

```
	$ pacmd load_module module-bluetooth-discover

```
List the available cards

```
	$ pactl list cards short

```
The upper output is still one audio card, but all we care is the audio sink, so we list all of the available audio sinks via:

```
	$ pactl list sinks short
	0	alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo	module-alsa-card.c	s16le 2ch 44100Hz	SUSPENDED
	1	alsa_output.btheadset	module-alsa-sink.c	s16le 2ch 44100Hz	SUSPENDED
Set the default audio sink to bluetooth headset: 
	$ pacmd set-default-sink 1

```
Congratulations! Now you can listen to music via bluetooth headset!
###Automatically Configuration
Following is the configuration for my machine, you have to adjust the parameters according to yourself:    
Comment the following items in /etc/pulse/default.pa, the module-bluetooth-policy should be commented, or the pulse audio will not start:

```
	### Automatically load driver modules for Bluetooth hardware
	#.ifexists module-bluetooth-policy.so
	#load-module module-bluetooth-policy
	#.endif
	#
	.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so
	load-module module-bluetooth-discover
	.endif

```
Surely you will start bluetooth daemon by default:

```
	$ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

```
Add "blueman-applet" into the awesome startup file(.config/awesome/rc.lua).     
The right steps for using bluetooth: 

1. Startup Your machine with bluetooth background and blueman-applet enabled. 
2. Power on your bluetooth headset. If your key is accepted permanately, the bluetooth headset will connect automatically. 
3. Manually add the audio sink via "pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset". 
4. Set the default route path of the audio sink via "pacmd set-default-sink 1" ( all of the audio sink could be listed via "pactl list sinks short")

Now you can enjoy the bluetooth, for convenient, I made an alias:

```
	alias enableblue='pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset && pacmd set-default-sink 1"

```

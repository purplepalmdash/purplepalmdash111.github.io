Following is the steps for installing ArchLinux on Surface Pro, from the very beginning.    
### Prerequisite
First you have to download the iso from [http://www.archlinux.org/download](http://www.archlinux.org/download), Mine is `2014.06.01`.    
Also I use a USB-LAN adapter which holds the following information:   `ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88772B`.     
A 8G Flash Disk, 80G USB3.0 USB HardDisk. I also use a 4-Port USB2.0 HUB which carries a AC/DC Adapter for using 3 equipemts(FlashDisk/USB Adapter/USB Disk).    
Make the bootable flash disk via:    

```
# dd if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M && sync

```
After it finished we insert the flash disk into the USB HUB, boot-up the Surface Pro Holding both the Power Key and Volumn - Key. Shortly we will go into the archlinux installtion shell.     
### Installation Of ArchLinux
These steps are mainly refers to following URL:    
[https://bbs.archlinuxcn.org/viewtopic.php?id=1037](https://bbs.archlinuxcn.org/viewtopic.php?id=1037)     
First start-up the sshd so we can remotely login onto the terminal, thus we could easily copy-paste the commands.     

#### Make partitions on disk
GPT Partition:    

```
cgdisk /dev/sdX

```
The Partition I made is as following:   

```
# fdisk -l /dev/sdb

Disk /dev/sdb: 74.5 GiB, 80026361856 bytes, 156301488 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: CEFF8C6A-A06A-46DF-9D10-F4C593C32CA0

Device           Start          End   Size Type
/dev/sdb1         2048      1050623   512M EFI System
/dev/sdb2      1050624      5244927     2G Linux swap
/dev/sdb3      5244928    156301454    72G Linux filesystem

```
Notice we have to make a seperated EFI partition, because surface pro is UEFI enablbed. We also have a 2-Gigabyte swap partition and remains all of the reset as the root partition.   
Now make the filesystems on the disk:   

```
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb3
# mkswap /dev/sdb2
# mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1 
```

If you are using SSD, then format the ext4 without journal will greatly extend your SSD
lifetime.    

But this option is not OK?    

```
# mkfs.ext4 -O "^has_journal" /dev/sd
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
# tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdb2
# tune2fs -o discard /dev/sdb2
```

Enable the swap partion:    

```
# swapon /dev/sdb2 

```

#### Installation Of Basic System
After creating the partition, mount them into the corresponding position:    

```
# mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt
# mkdir -p /mnt/boot/EFI/
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/boot/EFI/

```
Install the basic system: 

```
pacstrap -i /mnt base

```
Generate the fstab file:    

```
# genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

```
Examine the generate the fstab:    

```
# file /mnt/etc/fstab 
# cat /mnt/etc/fstab

```
Now you have the basic system installed the /dev/sdb, next step we will enter the system and configure this newly installed system.   
#### Configure The System
Enter the system via:    

```
# arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash

```
Locale:   

```
# vim /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen

```
Default Language:   

```
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8>/etc/locale.conf

```
Timezone:   

```
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime

```
HostName:    

```
# echo SurfacePro>/etc/hostname

```
Auto-configuring the network at startup:     

```
# systemctl start dhcpcd.service
# systemctl enable dhcpcd.service    

```
Set the password for root user:    

```
# passwd

```
Install grub with efi support:   

```
# pacman -S grub efibootmgr
# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/EFI --bootloader-id=arch_grub --recheck

```
Generate the configure files:    

```
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

```
#### Finish
Return to the installtion environment:    

```
exit

```
Umount new partion:    

```
# umount -R /mnt

```
Reboot via `shutdown -h now` and next time remove the flash-disk, also press power-up and volumn-down key together, this time you will be leading the usb-disk powered system.

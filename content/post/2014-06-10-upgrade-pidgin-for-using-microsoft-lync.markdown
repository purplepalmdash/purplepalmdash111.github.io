---

Since company has upgrade the IM tools from office communicator into Lync, thus I have to upgrade the pidgin's plugins for using lynx. Folloing is the tips:     
### Upgrade SIPE
Sipe is installed via yaourt:     

```
# yaourt -S pidgin-sipe

```
### Configure Pidgin
Edit the existing account via: Edit->Preference->Advanced.     
The connection type is `auto`, the authentication scheme is `TLS-DSK`.     
In the "User Agent", insert following:     

```
UCCAPI/15.0.4481.1000 OC/15.0.4481.1000

```
The detailed "User Agent" descriptions could be refered to following links:

Re-enable the account then you can use lync now.

Yes, two weeks ago I bought a surface pro, following is the steps for me to discover on Surface Pro. 
### Remote Viewer
Since the remote desktop server is not installed on surface pro, I have to install the remote viewer, I choose TeamViewer, the steps is quite easy. But it requires both side(client and server)both could reach internet.     
TeamViewer Download:

You can also install teamviewer from the yaourt of ArchLinux.

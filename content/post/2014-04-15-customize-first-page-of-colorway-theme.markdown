View picture exiv2 info via exiv2 command:     

```
	exiv2 slide-img-1.jpg
	Image size      : 897 x 350

```
So we must cut out a 897 x 350 picture for displaying as slide show.    

Now find out some pictures from internet, and download it to local.    

Use convert to fit the image?  No, it's not exact, I use gimp

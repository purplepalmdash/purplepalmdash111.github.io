### Installation
#### CentOS
Download the corresponding rpm files, install it via `sudo yum install ******.rpm`, this will automatically install the dependencies and also install the teamviewer for your centos system.    
#### Ubuntu
Only working for 14.04:     
First you have to add i686(i386) supporting:    

```
$ dpkg --add-architecture i386
$ apt-get update

```
Then you have to downloaded the following packages rather than the offcial packages(x64 or i386):    
[http://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_linux.deb](http://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_linux.deb)     
Install this `teamviewer_linux.deb`, and you got teamviewer running on your system.    
For 12.04, directly download the package from:    
[http://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_linux_x64.deb](http://download.teamviewer.com/download/teamviewer_linux_x64.deb)    
Then install it via:    

```
# dpkg -i teamviewer_linux_x64.deb
# apt-get install -f

```
Then teamviewer could be installed on your system.

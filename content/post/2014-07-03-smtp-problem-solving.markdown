Recently I've set up a ticket system, OTRS, which uses smtp for sending out email. It works well in my virtual machine, and in my own server. But when deploying it onto the lab PC, it cannot send out email via smtp. Following is the solving procedure for this problem.    
### SMTP Server
When Login into the server, following is how to using smtp for sending out email.    

```
$ telnet localhost 25
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 nxxxxx.xxx.fukcfuck-fugkock.com ESMTP Sendmail 8.14.5+Sun/8.13.3; Thu, 26 Jun 2014 06:43:37 -0500 (CDT)

### Error message
When sending out the /var/log/messages will record the failure message, like: 

```
Jul  1 00:57:10 Linux01 OTRS-CGI-37[2757]: [Info][Kernel::System::CustomerUser::DB::CustomerUserAdd] CustomerUser: '9988@qq.com' created successfully (1)!

Jul  1 00:57:12 Linux01 OTRS-CGI-37[2757]: [Error][Kernel::System::Email::SMTP::Send][Line:139]: Can't send to '9988@qq.com': 5505.7.1 <9988@qq.com>... Relaying denied. IP name lookup failed [104.xxx.xxx.53]#012! Enable Net::SMTP debug for more info!
Jul  1 00:57:12 Linux01 OTRS-CGI-37[2757]: [Info][Kernel::System::Email::Send] Error sending message

```

It says the IP name lookup failed.     
### Bug Shooting
Use tcpdump for capturing the package, comparing to the normal package.    
It indicates the message "IP name lookup failed [104.xxx.xxx.53]", so I guess this may caused by reverse refer of smtp server.   

Use dnslookup for the correct record:    

```
[Trusty@Linux01 ~]$ nslookup 104.xxx.xxx.53
Server:        104.xxx.xxx.xxx
Address:    104.xxx.xxx.xxx#53

** server can't find 53.xxx.xxx.104.in-addr.arpa.: NXDOMAIN

=============================================================


[Trusty@Linux01 ~]$ nslookup 104.xxx.xxx.240
Server:        104.xxx.xxx.xxx
Address:    104.xxx.xxx.xxx#53

Non-authoritative answer:
240.xxx.xxx.104.in-addr.arpa    name = xxxxxxxx.xx.fukcfuck-fugkock.com.

```

So the solution is quite clear: If we give 104.xxx.xxx.140 a name, we could easily reached this machine from smtp server, thus the problem may be solved.

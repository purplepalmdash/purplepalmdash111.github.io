Since I installed the ArchLinux around 3 months ago, but I am too busy to enable the bluetooth headset, now I am free finally, so this is the steps for enable the bluetooth headset.    
### Software Installation
Install blueman:    

```
$ sudo pacman -S blueman
$ sudo pacman -S bluez-utils bluez-libs python2-pybluez

```
Wait, this method is not OK for current bluez5, so I need to switch to other method.    
Use official website,  named"Bluetooth headset" on ArchLinux Wiki.    
### Bluez5/Pulseaudio
Install packages:    

```
$ sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-alsa bluez bluez-libs bluez-utils
$ systemctl start bluetooth

```
